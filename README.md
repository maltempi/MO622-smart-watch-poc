# smart-watch-poc
This project were developed as final test for MO622 (HCI) discipline of Unicamp (Brazil).
One of the main topics of that discipline was wearables devices and we used the Samsung Tizen Smart Watch for testing. The main focus that we wanted study were how a visually impaired individual could use a Smart Watch. It was just a kickoff for a research, however it wasn't developed enough for a paper or whatever else.
This project may be useful as well for developers that are interested on Tizen development learning.
