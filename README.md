# smart-watch-poc
This project were developed as final test for MO622 (HCI) discipline of Unicamp (Brazil).   

One of the main topics of that discipline was wearables devices and we used the Samsung Tizen Smart Watch for testing. The main focus that we wanted study were how a visual impaired (any level) person could use a Smart Watch. It was just a kickoff for a research, however it wasn't developed enough for a paper or whatever else.  

This project may be useful as well for developers that are interested on Tizen development learning.

## How it works

It is an app that suggest a way to help visual impaired (any level) person to cross a street on a traffic light. It has no integration with external device, the traffic light connection is a mock. The app contains colors changing, big letters and icons, vibration and sound. Check the storyboard.png for further details.
